Hello! 

I've like to explain myself that I had trouble with the pokemoncard API, I have tried making an .env file and bringing the API and using JSON to stringify the data but had a lot of trouble doing that. So instead, I accessed the website and wrote down the data myself.

Once again, thank you for this opportunity, I've learnt so much while doing this test.

Regards,
Jungkyu
